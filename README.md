# Two Thumbs

Two Thumbs is a user feedback system featuring

- no fancy metrics,
- no dashboards,
- no accounts,
- no SDKs, and
- no distractions.

It provides an API to post feedback to, AI-powered digests (delivered to Slack), and not much more, by design.

Since Two Thumbs is rather niche, I will be happy to personally assist you in getting started. Please reach out via contact@messier.ch.
